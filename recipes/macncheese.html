    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 cups milk </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese </li>
        <li>⅓ cup dill pickle relish, well drained </li>
        <li>¼ cup minced onion </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®) (Optional) </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 slice bread </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish 
            with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
             stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 minutes, making sure not to
              overcook. Drain and set aside.
         </li>
        <li>
            While the macaroni is cooking, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat in a large 
            saucepan. Blend in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture becomes paste-like and
             light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk and bring to a simmer over
              medium heat. Cook and stir until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
         </li>
        <li>
            Mix in Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese; stir until melted. Add dill pickle relish,
             onion, Sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper to cheese mixture. Stir in cooked macaroni. 
             Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
         </li>
        <li>
            Butter both sides of bread and tear into large pieces. Blend in a food processor or 
            electric blender until you have crumbs. Spread on top of casserole.

         </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned on top, about 45 minutes.
         </li>

    </ol>
